## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size

- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first React project and my main goal was to teach myself the basics of building React apps. I think I've managed to gain a good grasp of the React life-cycle and the basics of how to build components, though I leave it for others to decide how well I've implemented them...

I also set myself the goal of using CSS transitions extensively to get a better grasp of what can be done with them.
